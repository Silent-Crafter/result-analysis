Extracts result data from pdf files and analyses them.

---

College result analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating academic performance, identifying areas for improvement, and informing educational decisions. Several existing projects have explored various techniques for data extraction, storage, analysis, and visualization. 

This project builds upon existing analysis methods by extracting data from PDFs and performing similar calculations for pass percentages, grade distributions, etc. 

However, it deviates by focusing on real-time analysis and visualization within a Windows application, eliminating the need for database storage at this stage. 
This approach streamlines the process for immediate result analysis.
